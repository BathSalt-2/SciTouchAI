# Project Plan

## Overview
This project aims to develop a cutting-edge mobile application that leverages the latest advances in artificial intelligence, data science, and machine learning to analyze complex scientific data sets.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Data Processing
- Develop `src/data_processing.py` to handle the processing of scientific data.
- Implement `processData` function to process the scientific data.
- Write tests for data processing in `src/tests/test_data_processing.py`.

### Milestone 2: User Interface
- Develop `src/user_interface.py` to handle the user interface of the application.
- Implement `handleTouchscreenInput` function to handle user input.
- Write tests for user interface in `src/tests/test_user_interface.py`.

### Milestone 3: Machine Learning and AI
- Develop `src/machine_learning.py` and `src/artificial_intelligence.py` to handle machine learning and AI functionalities.
- Implement `processNaturalLanguage` function to process natural language input.
- Write tests for machine learning and AI in `src/tests/test_machine_learning.py` and `src/tests/test_artificial_intelligence.py`.

### Milestone 4: Cyber Security
- Develop `src/cyber_security.py` to handle the security of the application.
- Implement `encryptData` and `authenticateUser` functions to handle data encryption and user authentication.
- Write tests for cyber security in `src/tests/test_cyber_security.py`.

### Milestone 5: Mobile Optimization and Responsive Design
- Develop `src/mobile_optimization.py` and `src/responsive_design.py` to handle mobile optimization and responsive design.
- Implement `optimizeForMobile` and `applyResponsiveDesign` functions to optimize the application for mobile devices and apply responsive design principles.
- Write tests for mobile optimization and responsive design in `src/tests/test_mobile_optimization.py` and `src/tests/test_responsive_design.py`.

### Milestone 6: Aesthetics and Usability
- Develop `src/aesthetics.py` and `src/usability.py` to handle the aesthetics and usability of the application.
- Implement `applyAesthetics` and `optimizeUsability` functions to apply aesthetic design principles and optimize usability.
- Write tests for aesthetics and usability in `src/tests/test_aesthetics.py` and `src/tests/test_usability.py`.

## Timeline
- Milestone 1: Week 1-2
- Milestone 2: Week 3-4
- Milestone 3: Week 5-6
- Milestone 4: Week 7-8
- Milestone 5: Week 9-10
- Milestone 6: Week 11-12

## Risk Management
Potential risks include data security breaches, software bugs, and delays in development. These will be mitigated by following best practices for software engineering and cyber security, and by maintaining a rigorous testing and review process.

## Documentation
Documentation will be maintained in the `docs` directory, including a `requirements.txt` for project dependencies, a `design_document.md` for design details, a `user_manual.md` for user instructions, a `test_plan.md` for testing strategies, and this `project_plan.md` for project planning details.

## Progress Reporting
Progress will be tracked and reported in `docs/progress_report.md`.
