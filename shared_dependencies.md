Shared Dependencies:

1. Exported Variables:
   - "dataSet": This variable will hold the scientific data sets that will be used across multiple modules for analysis and processing.
   - "userInput": This variable will capture and store user inputs from the touchscreen interface, to be used across various modules.

2. Data Schemas:
   - "userDataSchema": This schema will define the structure of user data, including authentication details, and will be used across the authentication, cyber security, and software engineering modules.
   - "dataSetSchema": This schema will define the structure of the scientific data sets, and will be used across the data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence modules.

3. DOM Element IDs:
   - "touchScreenInput": This ID will be used by the touchscreen_input.py and human_computer_interaction.py files to handle user inputs.
   - "displayArea": This ID will be used by the aesthetics.py, usability.py, journalism.py, and music_theory.py files to control the display and presentation of data and interfaces.

4. Message Names:
   - "authSuccess": This message will be used across the authentication.py and cyber_security.py files to signal successful user authentication.
   - "dataProcessed": This message will be used across the data_analysis.py, machine_learning.py, and artificial_intelligence.py files to signal the completion of data processing.

5. Function Names:
   - "processData": This function will be used across the data_analysis.py, machine_learning.py, and artificial_intelligence.py files to process the scientific data sets.
   - "authenticateUser": This function will be used across the authentication.py and cyber_security.py files to handle user authentication.
   - "renderUI": This function will be used across the responsive_design.py, aesthetics.py, usability.py, journalism.py, and music_theory.py files to render the user interface.
